With the aid of ""NerveGear"" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.

Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed ""Kirito,"" is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game.

To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life.
